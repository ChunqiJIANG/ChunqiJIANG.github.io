Abstract
-----
Here, we present the draft genome sequences of three Croceitalea sp. strains containing microbial rhodopsins, isolated from the Japanese coastal sea surface microlayer, which is exposed to intense sunlight. 
This study will contribute to the understanding of the genus Croceitalea and the diversity of microbial rhodopsins.
