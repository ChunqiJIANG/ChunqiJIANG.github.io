Abstract
-----
Microbiome in early life has long-term effects on the host’s immunological and physiological development and its disturbance is known to trigger various diseases in host Deuterostome animals. 
The sea cucumber *Apostichopus japonicus* is one of the most valuable marine Deuterostome invertebrates in Asia and a model animal in regeneration studies. 
To understand factors that impact on host development and holobiont maintenance, host-microbiome association has been actively studied in the last decade. 
However, we currently lack knowledge of early life core microbiome during its ontogenesis and how it benefits the host’s growth.
