Abstract
-----
The Splendidus clade is the largest clade in Vibrionaceae, and its members are often related to mortality of marine animals with huge economic losses. The molecular bases of their pathogenicity and virulence, however, remain largely unknown. In particular, the complete genome sequences of the Splendidus clade species are rarely registered, which is one of the obstacles to predict core and/or unique genes responsible for their adaptation and pathogenicity, and to perform a fine scale meta-transcriptome during bacterial infection to their hosts. In this study, we obtained the complete genomes of all type strains in the Splendidus clade and revealed that (1) different genome sizes (4.4–5.9 Mb) with V. lentus the biggest and most of them had several big plasmids, likely because of the different features on mobilome elements; (2) the Splendidus clade consists of 19 species except V. cortegadensis, and 3 sub-clades (SC) were defined with the 15 most closely related members as SC1; (3) different carbohydrate degradation preferences may be the result of environmental adaptation; and (4) a broad prediction of virulence factors (VFs) revealed core and species unique VF genes.
