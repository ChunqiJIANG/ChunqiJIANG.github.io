Abstract
-----
The genus *Thalassotalea* is ubiquitous in marine environments, and up to 20 species have been described so far. 
A Gram-staining-negative, aerobic bacterium, designated strain PTE2T was isolated from laboratory-reared larvae of the Japanese sea cucumber *Apostichopus japonicus*. 
Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequences revealed that PTE2T was closely related to *Thalassotalea sediminis* N211T (= KCTC 42588T = MCCC 1H00116T) with 97.9% sequence similarity. 
ANI and in silico DDH values against *Thalassotalea* species were 68.5–77.0% and 19.7–24.6%, respectively, indicating the novelty of PTE2T. 
Based on genome-based taxonomic approaches, strain PTE2T (= JCM 34608T = KCTC 82592T) is proposed as a new species, *Thalassotalea hakodatensis* sp. nov.
